# 🌾 Analyzing Agricultural Productivity Across Indian States using Power BI

## ❓ Problem Statement

> How can Indian states improve agricultural productivity while optimizing the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and natural resources like rainfall?

## ✅ Solution

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to:

* Track **average and total crop production** per state
* Compare **input usage (fertilizers/pesticides)** with output
* Visualize **seasonal and crop-wise production patterns**
* Highlight **key contributing crops and regions**
  
## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a data-driven analysis of agricultural productivity across various Indian states using Power BI. The primary goal is to uncover insights on how rainfall, fertilizers, and pesticide usage influence crop production and to identify patterns that can enhance resource efficiency and yield optimization.
 

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze **agricultural productivity trends** across Indian states.
* Evaluate the **impact of rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide usage** on crop yield.
* Identify the **most productive crops and contributing states**.
* Provide insights to improve **agricultural efficiency and sustainability**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Power BI** – Data visualization and interactive dashboard design
* **Excel / CSV** – Data preparation, cleaning, and formatting
* **Power BI Filters & Slicers** – State-wise, crop-wise, and seasonal filtering

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**
   Collected state-wise data on:

   * Rainfall
   * Fertilizer & pesticide usage
   * Crop-wise production

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**

   * Handled missing values and standardized formats
   * Filtered data for clarity and accuracy

3. **Dashboard Development**

   * Created visuals like bar graphs, pie charts, and trend lines
   * Enabled multi-level filtering and slicing by crop, state, and season

4. **Analysis**

   * Correlated inputs with yield outcomes
   * Compared seasonal trends and energy/resource usage

## 📊 Key Insights

* **Kerala** emerged as the highest contributor to crop production (\~42%)
* **Coconut** is the top-yielding crop by volume
* **Higher fertilizer use** doesn’t always mean higher yield
* **Whole Year** season dominates crop production (\~97%)
* Strategic focus on **high-yield crops/states** can improve planning and sustainability
